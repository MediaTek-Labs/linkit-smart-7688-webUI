For example:\n *\n *                                            <Paper>\n *  <Paper>                                     <div> // See notice\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>        renders         <div/> // before element\n *      [children of paper]       ------>         [children of paper]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                       <div/> // after element\n *  </Paper>                                    </div>\n *                                            </Paper>\n *\n *  Notice: Notice that this div bundles together our elements. If the element\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\n *\n *  <p>\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\n *  </p>\n *\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\n *\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\n */\n\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'BeforeAfterWrapper',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  propTypes: {\n    beforeStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    afterStyle: React.PropTypes.object,\n    beforeElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    afterElementType: React.PropTypes.string,\n    elementType: React.PropTypes.string\n  },\n\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      beforeElementType: 'div',\n      afterElementType: 'div',\n      elementType: 'div'\n    };\n  },\n\n  render: function render() {\n    var _props = this.props;\n    var beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle;\n    var afterStyle = _props.afterStyle;\n    var beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType;\n    var afterElementType = _props.afterElementType;\n    var elementType = _props.elementType;\n\n    var other = _objectWithoutProperties(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\n\n    var beforeElement = undefined,\n        afterElement = undefined;\n\n    beforeStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n    afterStyle = AutoPrefix.all({ boxSizing: 'border-box' });\n\n    if (this.props.beforeStyle) beforeElement = React.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(beforeStyle, this.props.beforeStyle),\n      key: \"::before\"\n    });\n    if (this.props.afterStyle) afterElement = React.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\n      style: this.mergeAndPrefix(afterStyle, this.props.afterStyle),\n      key: \"::after\"\n    });\n\n    var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\n\n    var props = other;\n    props.style = this.props.style;\n\n    return React.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\n  }\n\n});\n\nmodule.exports = BeforeAfterWrapper;\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/material-ui/lib/before-after-wrapper.js\n ** module id = 358\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","'use strict';\n\nvar _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; };\n\nfunction _objectWithoutProperties(obj, keys) { var target = {}; for (var i in obj) { if (keys.indexOf(i) >= 0) continue; if (!Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, i)) continue; target[i] = obj[i]; } return target; }\n\nvar React = require('react');\nvar Paper = require('../paper');\nvar StylePropable = require('../mixins/style-propable');\nvar CardExpandable = require('./card-expandable');\n\nvar Card = React.createClass({\n  displayName: 'Card',\n\n  mixins: [StylePropable],\n\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return { expanded: this.props.initiallyExpanded ?

This is\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n *\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *   CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\nvar Dispatcher = (function () {\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    _classCallCheck(this, Dispatcher);\n\n    this._callbacks = {};\n    this._isDispatching = false;\n    this._isHandled = {};\n    this._isPending = {};\n    this._lastID = 1;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.

Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n *\n * @param {string} topLevelType Record from `EventConstants`.\n * @param {string} topLevelTargetID ID of deepest React rendered element.\n * @param {object} nativeEvent Native browser event.\n * @return {*} An accumulation of synthetic events.\n */\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(\n    topLevelType,\n    topLevelTargetID,\n    nativeEvent) {\n  var shouldSetEventType =\n    isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder :\n    isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder :\n    eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = responderID || topLevelTargetID;\n  var shouldSetEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    shouldSetEventType,\n    bubbleShouldSetFrom,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n  EventPropagators.accumulateTwoPhaseDispatches(shouldSetEvent);\n  var wantsResponderID = executeDispatchesInOrderStopAtTrue(shouldSetEvent);\n  if (!shouldSetEvent.isPersistent()) {\n    shouldSetEvent.constructor.release(shouldSetEvent);\n  }\n\n  if (!wantsResponderID || wantsResponderID === responderID) {\n    return null;\n  }\n  var extracted;\n  var grantEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n    eventTypes.responderGrant,\n    wantsResponderID,\n    nativeEvent\n  );\n\n  EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(grantEvent);\n  if (responderID) {\n    var terminationRequestEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n      eventTypes.responderTerminationRequest,\n      responderID,\n      nativeEvent\n    );\n    EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminationRequestEvent);\n    var shouldSwitch = !hasDispatches(terminationRequestEvent) ||\n      executeDirectDispatch(terminationRequestEvent);\n    if (!terminationRequestEvent.isPersistent()) {\n      terminationRequestEvent.constructor.release(terminationRequestEvent);\n    }\n\n    if (shouldSwitch) {\n      var terminateType = eventTypes.responderTerminate;\n      var terminateEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        terminateType,\n        responderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(terminateEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, [grantEvent, terminateEvent]);\n      responderID = wantsResponderID;\n    } else {\n      var rejectEvent = SyntheticEvent.getPooled(\n        eventTypes.responderReject,\n        wantsResponderID,\n        nativeEvent\n      );\n      EventPropagators.accumulateDirectDispatches(rejectEvent);\n      extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, rejectEvent);\n    }\n  } else {\n    extracted = accumulateInto(extracted, grantEvent);\n    responderID = wantsResponderID;\n  }\n  return extracted;\n}\n\n/**\n * A transfer is a negotiation between a currently set responder and the next\n * element to claim responder status.
